### Top Buttons
 
 The screen will start at "Codex" by default. 
 
 Instruction: Quickly switch between "Codex" and "Notes" by pressing the buttons on their left and then right side.
 
 Watch for: unresponsiveness, lag, flickering or poorly fitting screens.
 

### Codex


  Instruction: In the "Codex" click each of the round icons in turn to test screen response, once at the top and again at the bottom.
  
  Watch for: Unresponsiveness, lag, resizing of windows. Header title should change with each button. 
  
  
  Instruction: Select a category in the upper grey bar, then in the displayed subcategories press each in turn in a different location. 
  
  Watch for: Unresponsiveness and lag. Some categories might not have entries dedicated to them yet. If they do, watch for window flickering or resizing.
  
  
  Instruction: In a subcategory that has entries to its right associated with it, click the entries in various location in sequence. 
  
  Watch for: As above, each entry button should display a different set of information on the right hand side. Some might have an image, some might not. 
  
### Notes

  When in Notes, it should automatically select "Act 1" for you.
  
  
  Instruction: Create 5 unique entries into each act. Close the application, then open it again. Go through each act again in Notes.
  
  Watch for: All your entries from before should have been saved. No distortion of the window should have occured during entry.
  
  
  Instruction: Of your created entries, delete the first, middle, and last one. Do so for each Act. Close the application and start it again.
  
  Watch for: All your your remaining entries are there, and the deleted ones are gone.
